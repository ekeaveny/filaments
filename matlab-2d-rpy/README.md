# 2D Matlab RPY code: README

Supplementary Matlab/Octave code to [arXiv address here] by [Author names].

## 2. What does this code do?
This code demonstrates the use of the method described in the paper [link] in simulating a single flexible filament falling under gravity in an infinite domain.

It uses the 'EJBb' version of Broyden's method (Algorithm 2 in the paper) with a reduced 'robot arm' system of nonlinear equations. For the hydrodynamic solver, it uses the RPY tensors.

## 3. How do I run it?
To use, just run `main.m` in Matlab.
